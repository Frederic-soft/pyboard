# pyboard
Pyboard-specific Micropython modules

* [AdafruitMotorshieldV2](./AdafruitMotorshieldV2) allows the pyboard to control stepper motors, DC motors and servomotors using Adafruit's motor shield V2 for the Arduino.
* [BME280](./BME280) allows the pyboard to measure the atmospheric temperature, pressure and relative humidity thanks to the BME280 sensor.
* [HCSR04](./HCSR04) allows the pyboard to measure distances with the HCSR04 ultrasonic telemeter.
* [HT16K334x7](./HT16K334x7) allows the pyboard to drive a 7-segment 4-digit LED display with HT16K33 backpack.
* [MAX7219](./MAX7219) allows the pyboard to use a MAX7219 to drive LEDs. A module is provided to drive an 8 by 8 LED matrix.
* [MMA7660](./MMA7660) gives access to the MMA7660 accelerometer of the pyboard. A spirit level is given as an example, using an 8 by 8 LED matrix to display the "bubble".
* [Step28BYJ48](./Step28BYJ48) allows the pyboard to drive a 28BYJ-48 stepper motor.
* [TMP36](./TMP36) is an interface to the popular TMP36 temperature sensor.
